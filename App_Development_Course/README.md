# App Developement Course Directory
This repository contains some examples of mobile applications that I developed through the iOS 11 & Swift 4 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp Udemy Course. Note, although the code is code I wrote, the project ideas and tutorials are all property of Angela Yu - the creator of the course. I highly recommend this course for anyone interested in mobile app developement.
